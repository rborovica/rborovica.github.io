                        <strong>Intelligent Intersection Management for Improved Traffic Safety: Unpredictable pedestrian behaviour, such as jaywalking, poses a major challenge for safe and efficient traffic signal control at urban intersections.</strong> This project aims to fully automate adaptive traffic signal management using deep reinforcement learning with an explicit probabilistic model of pedestrian uncertainty Our approach moves beyond fixed, vehicle-centric strategies and continuously adapts to evolving pedestrian behaviours that exploit signal timings to minimise their own travel time. By modelling interactions between pedestrians, traffic signals, and connected autonomous vehicles, the proposed framework learns robust control policies that improve both intersection efficiency and safety. This research establishes a new foundation for intelligent, pedestrian-aware traffic management in next-generation smart cities.

                        <strong>Automated Scientific Insight Discovery with Goal Directed AI.</strong> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is essential for uncovering insights in large-scale datasets, yet current systems disrupt analytical workflows by requiring explicit feedback through tuple rankings and example validation This project introduces implicit recommendation systems that understand analyst intent through natural exploration behavior, observing queries, interactions, and exploration sequences without interrupting cognitive flow. Our approach employs a novel multi-dimensional interestingness contribution scheme combining association rule mining, diversity-based summarization, and temporal behavioral modeling to predict analytical interest. Unlike similarity-based systems, our framework simultaneously captures structural patterns, distributional anomalies, temporal trends, and compositional relationships, adapting in real-time as goals evolve. Validation on SDSS astronomical query logs and SIMBA benchmarks demonstrates consistent improvements over single-objective approaches, particularly for complex analytical workloads. This vision addresses fundamental challenges in real-time interest adaptation, interpretability, and cross-domain transfer for database exploration.

By modeling and automating the iterative reasoning process traditionally performed by human DBAs, my work seeks to improve database performance across diverse workloads while lowering tuning cost and improving robustness. Ultimately, this research aims to build practical, learning-based tuning systems that can generalize across benchmarks and real-world environments.
