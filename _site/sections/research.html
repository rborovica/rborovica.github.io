      <h3>Automated Database Tuning</h3>
      <p>This project focuses on automatically optimizing database performance, reducing reliance on costly expert intervention. We investigate both physical design tuning (e.g., indexes and materialized views) and configuration tuning, leveraging techniques such as multi-armed bandits and large language models.</p>

      <h3>(Machine) Learned Indexes</h3>
      <p>In this line of work, we exploit data distributions to construct compact, ML-based indexes for faster and more efficient data retrieval. We study the efficiency and practicality of existing learned index models and propose new algorithms suitable for on-disk deployment, a critical requirement for industrial adoption. This line of work also includes learned spatial indexes and spatial query processing, including semantic search.</p>

      <h3>Semantics-Driven Prefetching</h3>
      <p>This project investigates how to anticipate and preload relevant data to reduce query latency and improve exploration efficiency. We leverage data and query semantics to predict complex access patterns that arise during exploratory data analysis, particularly in scientific domains.</p>

      <h3>Cardinality Estimation</h3>
      <p>This project aims to predict query result sizes in order to improve query planning and execution performance. Our approach leverages copulas from statistical machine learning theory to model complex data correlations more accurately.</p>

      <h3>Learning-Based Traffic Optimisation</h3>
      <p>This line of work develops learning-based methods for traffic modelling, prediction, and optimisation in intelligent transportation systems. We leverage data-driven and machine learning techniques to support traffic management, routing, and decision making under dynamic and uncertain conditions.</p>
