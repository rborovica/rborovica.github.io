    I am an Associate Professor in Data Analytics and ARC DECRA Fellow in the School of Computing and
    Information Systems, and Associate Dean (Diversity and Inclusion) for the Faculty of Engineering and
    IT at the University of Melbourne. My research lies at the intersection of database systems, machine
    learning, and AI, with a focus on adaptive, self-driving data systems for efficient and cost-effective
    analytics. My work has been recognised with multiple awards, including the L'Oréal-UNESCO for Women in
    Science Fellowship, a SIGMOD Test of Time Award, and the Women in AI Award (APAC).

          I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Melbourne, working on AI for databases—
          including spatial indexing, reinforcement learning-based query optimization, and LLM applications.
          My recent research explores the use of space-filling curves for efficient spatial data
          organization and cost modeling. Previously, I was a Senior Software Engineer at Baidu, and received
          my M.S. and B.Eng. degrees from Northeastern University in China.

          Intelligent Intersection Management for Improved Traffic Safety: Unpredictable pedestrian
          behaviour, such as jaywalking, poses a major challenge for safe and efficient traffic signal
          control at urban intersections. This project aims to fully automate adaptive traffic signal
          management using deep reinforcement learning with an explicit probabilistic model of pedestrian
          uncertainty. Our approach moves beyond fixed, vehicle-centric strategies and continuously adapts
          to evolving pedestrian behaviours that exploit signal timings to minimise their own travel time.
          By modelling interactions between pedestrians, traffic signals, and connected autonomous vehicles,
          the proposed framework learns robust control policies that improve both intersection efficiency
          and safety. This research establishes a new foundation for intelligent, pedestrian-aware traffic
          management in next-generation smart cities.

          Automated Scientific Insight Discovery with Goal Directed AI. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is
          essential for uncovering insights in large-scale datasets, yet current systems disrupt analytical
          workflows by requiring explicit feedback through tuple rankings and example validation. This
          project introduces implicit recommendation systems that understand analyst intent through natural
          exploration behavior, observing queries, interactions, and exploration sequences without
          interrupting cognitive flow. Our approach employs a novel multi-dimensional interestingness
          contribution scheme combining association rule mining, diversity-based summarization, and temporal
          behavioral modeling to predict analytical interest. Unlike similarity-based systems, our framework
          simultaneously captures structural patterns, distributional anomalies, temporal trends, and
          compositional relationships, adapting in real-time as goals evolve. Validation on SDSS astronomical
          query logs and SIMBA benchmarks demonstrates consistent improvements over single-objective
          approaches, particularly for complex analytical workloads. This vision addresses fundamental
          challenges in real-time interest adaptation, interpretability, and cross-domain transfer for
          database exploration.

          Fuzzing and Human-in-the-loop fuzzing. My research addresses the coverage-plateau problem in
          grey-box fuzzing by leveraging query-based code databases to introspect fuzzing results. By
          identifying and bypassing fuzz blockers that impede discovery, I aim to make vulnerability
          detection more effective. Furthermore, I integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate
          blocker analysis, reducing manual overhead and advancing the efficiency of human-in-the-loop
          fuzzing workflows.

          Research on Intelligent Database Performance Tuning. My research focuses on intelligent and
          automated database performance tuning, aiming to reduce the reliance on manual expertise in
          configuring complex database systems. I study how machine learning and large language models can
          be used to understand workloads, system states, and configuration interactions, and to make
          adaptive tuning decisions in a principled manner. By modeling and automating the iterative
          reasoning process traditionally performed by human DBAs, my work seeks to improve database
          performance across diverse workloads while lowering tuning cost and improving robustness.
          Ultimately, this research aims to build practical, learning-based tuning systems that can
          generalize across benchmarks and real-world environments.
