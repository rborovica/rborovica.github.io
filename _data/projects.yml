projects:
  - title: "Automated Database Tuning"
    text: >-
      This project focuses on automatically optimizing database performance, reducing reliance on costly
      expert intervention. We investigate both physical design tuning (e.g., indexes and materialized
      views) and configuration tuning, leveraging techniques such as multi-armed bandits and large
      language models.

  - title: "(Machine) Learned Indexes"
    text: >-
      In this line of work, we exploit data distributions to construct compact, ML-based indexes for
      faster and more efficient data retrieval. We study the efficiency and practicality of existing
      learned index models and propose new algorithms suitable for on-disk deployment, a critical
      requirement for industrial adoption. This line of work also includes learned spatial indexes and
      spatial query processing, including semantic search.

  - title: "Semantics-Driven Prefetching"
    text: >-
      This project investigates how to anticipate and preload relevant data to reduce query latency and
      improve exploration efficiency. We leverage data and query semantics to predict complex access
      patterns that arise during exploratory data analysis, particularly in scientific domains.
    pubs: "[VLDB'24]"
  - title: "Cardinality Estimation"
    text: >-
      This project aims to predict query result sizes in order to improve query planning and execution
      performance. Our approach leverages copulas from statistical machine learning theory to model
      complex data correlations more accurately.

  - title: "Predicting Next Actions in Data Exploration"
    text: >-
      This project focuses on learning and recommending relevant next steps during interactive data
      exploration, guiding users through complex analysis workflows and reducing the cognitive and
      technical burden of exploratory analysis.
    pubs: "[CIKM'25]"
  - title: "Learning-Based Traffic Optimisation"
    text: >-
      This line of work develops learning-based methods for traffic modelling, prediction, and
      optimisation in intelligent transportation systems. We leverage data-driven and machine learning
      techniques to support traffic management, routing, and decision making under dynamic and uncertain
      conditions.
